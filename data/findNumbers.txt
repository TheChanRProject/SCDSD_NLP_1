So yeah I was calling my girlfriend last night and she changed her number.
I literally dialed 909-829-1019 like 15 times, but
it kept going to voicemail so I was literally freaking out, but then she gave me her new number 9099280191 . At that point,
I wanted to make sure her email was still the same since I needed to send her links.
My cousin mistook my number 909.731.2567 as (909)-732-2568
